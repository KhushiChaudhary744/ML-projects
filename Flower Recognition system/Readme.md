# News Articles Classification
In this project we will be working with a dataset containing pictures of various flowers saved in folders named by their species.

## GOAL - 
     Build a ML model capable of identifying various species of flowers.

## WHAT I HAVE DONE - 
  Combined data from all folders and stored it in two vectors containig strings of species and corresponding photos.
  Label Encoding and one hot encoding of the data.
  Built a model using Tensorflow and Keras.
  Evaluated model performance
